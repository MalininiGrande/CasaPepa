    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      Ever since I was a kid, I have always loved to plan things. Oh, the things
      I planned! From English classes for my plush toy friends and crazy
      action-packed ventures with my human friends to my grandparents quit
      smoking regimes and my mom's love life. This love and almost a physical
      need to plan sticked with me to my adulthood and steered me into a
      direction which enables me to do what I love and find the most sense in
      for a living...and here I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily I have grown and can know use my mad planning skills for people
      that are actually benefiting from it. Starting my career as a registration
      coordinator and later event assistant with GUARANT Intl. company was a
      great school for me. Apart from organizing small events for dozens of
      people to huge events of several thousands, I have discovered that I am
      not only a great planner, but I am super resilient to stress, can think
      clearly even under pressure, can communicate with almost anyone even if we
      do not speak common language, am a team player, although need a certain
      level of independence and decision making powers and much more!
    </p>
    <p>
      When I moved to my current job, Activities Associate in the International
      School of Prague, I discovered one more passion - service and
      volunteering. Why would not anyone want to make world a better place,
      right? This aspect of planning makes the final product or event even more
      rewarding not only for me but also for the participants, therefore lately
      I have been trying to sneak in all those little service parts (runs,
      community helps, service challenges etc.) and really make a difference. My
      wild imagination and knowledge of many online tools and software helps my
      greatly in this effort.

      spoiled brat dogs and my husband, I am a bookworm and to no one's surprise
      organizing reading clubs and I am always keen on improving my cooking,
      eating or yoga skills.
